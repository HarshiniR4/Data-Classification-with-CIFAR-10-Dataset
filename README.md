# Data Classification with CIFAR 10 Dataset

## Problem 1
CIFAR-10 dataset consists of images classified into 10 classes. In this solution I have utilised tensorflow, Keras and the concept of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify the images into the classes.

There are 10 class of images:
1. Airplane
2. Automobile
3. Bird
4. Cat
5. Deer
6. Dog
7. Frog
8. Horse
9. Ship
10. Truck

As given in the problem I have divided the dataset into training and test and built a 5-layer CNN to classify the images. The output is displayed in a grid with each row representing a class of images and the 10 images selected in random.
